> Minimal, promise‑based toolkit that makes the Google Drive API feel like a local filesystem.

## Vision

- **Path‑first API** – work with `"folder/sub/file.txt"` paths instead of cryptic file IDs.  
- **Batteries included** – helpers for reading, writing, moving and syncing files & folders.  
- **Zero boilerplate** – wraps the official *googleapis* client so you can focus on features, not plumbing.

## Semi-automatic sync service
You can expect simple service that will sync local folder with remote folder for you.

## Status

This library is **experimental** – I'm actively working on it and running everyday tests.  
Expect sharp edges, frequent refactors and breaking changes until v1.0.
